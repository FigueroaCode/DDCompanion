DnD is a fun, imagintive game that relies on the use of a character sheet to record information for adventures. 
However, game times can be long due to the constant erasing and searching of character information in the books. 
In order to simplify the game and ease the process of playing, 
an android app will be used to perform calculations and keep track of character information.
